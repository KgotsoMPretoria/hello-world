# hello-world
My first account with Umuzi.org. 
My name is Kgotso Mfopa.
I am a 21 year old man, staying in Pretoria.
I matriculated from Pretoia Boys High School in 2020.
In my spare time I like sketching and painting aswell as gaming online.
I'd like to be enrolled in the Umuzi organisation as this will further my knowledge of coding.
